# Hello World, New Website!
Wow, we finally did it, we have a brand new website that we can use! Should I get the candles of should you? Putting celebrations aside, yes we have a new website that can be browsed to your heart's content. And yes, I know it looks a bit bare at the moment but we're working towards building a proper website, from the ground up using HTML5 (instead of just markdown which is what it is currently). Below, we've listed a few questions that you might have.

## Where can I find the website?
*To get to our main homepage, click the [otd.ink](https://otd.ink) text above or just search https://otd.ink into your web browser.*

## What has changed for me?
*The only thing that has changed is where the rules are kept. Before, there was a Google Doc. Now, we have a specific url you can link to!*

## It looks really boring at the moment, is this going to change?
*Yes, but it's going to take a lot more time. HTML takes a lot longer to write and encode than a markdown script but eventually we'll have it ready to use.*

## Can I register on here on the website?
*Not yet, but on the upcoming HTML website we're working at a way to have registration operate entirely on the website.*

## Who's building this website?
*This website was built from the ground up by LeptoSpira, and is being currently maintained by both DJam98 and LeptoSpira. But the new website will be built by both LeptoSpira and DJam98 together.*

We're going to continue working on improving your experience with Off the Dial. Whether that be through websites, smash.gg, Discord and of course the actual tournament experience, we're here to make this experience be the best it can be.

Stay Tuned!
